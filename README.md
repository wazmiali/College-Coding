About College-Coding

College-Coding is a collection of programming exercises, projects, and learning resources created during my B.Tech journey. It includes solutions and experiments in Data Structures & Algorithms (C++, Java, Python, C), Machine Learning labs, Python projects, and practice code for coursework.

This repo is meant as a personal coding archive and a resource for students who want to learn by example—covering topics like file handling, data processing, exception handling, and basic ML with datasets (CSV files included).

Whether you’re practicing DSA, exploring Python projects, or revising Java fundamentals, this repository serves as a reference to understand concepts and build upon them.
